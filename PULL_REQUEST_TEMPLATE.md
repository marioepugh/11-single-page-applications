#### Single-line Summary
**Today, Mario and John paired together. It took about 2.5**

#### Reflect and summarize on your process for each `TODO` item :  
  1. First, we prepared our index.html page by adding the routes to our href on the navigation elements and then we added the script files for page.js and routes.js
  2. Next, we configured routes.js with page.js for home and about links and called it.
  3. Next, created the articleController function that invoked the fetchAll function and showed all the articles.
  4. Then we set up the about controller to hide the articles and show the #about section when the about link was clicked.
  5. Finally we removed the hold nav handler and function from articleView.js
